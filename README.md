Hi there!

You can find projects I completed during my Data Analyst training in this repository.

- The first project is an exploratory analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL.
- The next project involves cleaning Nashville Housing data using SQL.
- The third project is cleaning and creating a dashboard of Bike Sales data using Excel.
- The fourth project is creating a dashboard of AirBnB data using Tableau. Here is the link to this project: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/szymon.pawlak7133/viz/AirBnBproject_17243224954860/Dashboard1?publish=yes.
