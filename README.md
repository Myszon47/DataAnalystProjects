Hi there!

You can find projects I completed during my Data Analyst training in this repository.

- The first project is an exploratory analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL.
- The next project involves cleaning Nashville Housing data using SQL.
- The third project is cleaning and creating dashboard of Bike Sales data using Excel.
